/**
 * Run the plugin builder, from wherever it can be found.
 *
 * The transform that turns `plugin.ts` into the `plugin.js` this repository ships
 * belongs to the game, not to this mod: the rules it enforces are the plugin ABI. It
 * lives at `packages/mod-sdk/bin/neo-angband-mod-build.mjs` in the game's repository and
 * ships inside `@rpgm-tools/neo-angband-mod-sdk`.
 *
 * THREE SOURCES, IN ORDER, and the order is not arbitrary:
 *
 *   1. NEO_ANGBAND_REPO, when it is set. Setting it is a deliberate act, so it wins
 *      outright rather than being weighed against anything else.
 *   2. The published SDK in node_modules. This is the default, because plugin.js is a
 *      shipped artefact and building it against a pinned copy is what makes the result
 *      reproducible by somebody who does not have a checkout of the game. It is also
 *      the path a third-party mod author takes, and the reason the tool is published.
 *   3. A sibling checkout at ../neo-angband. Available for developing against an engine
 *      change that has not reached the registry yet, and below the published copy so
 *      that a neighbouring working tree cannot quietly decide what gets published.

 * goes in the catalogue, so building it against an unpinned tree is a way to
 * publish something nobody else can reproduce. The sibling stays available, below
 * the pinned copy, for working on the SDK and a mod together.
