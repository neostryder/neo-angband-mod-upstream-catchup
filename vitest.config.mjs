/**
 * Test config, whose only job is an OPT-IN path to a local engine.
 *
 * By default these tests import `@rpgm-tools/neo-angband-core` from node_modules -
 * the PUBLISHED engine, the version a player actually runs. That default is
 * deliberate and package.json says so: a mod that passes against an unreleased
 * engine and fails against the released one has been tested against the wrong
 * thing.
 *
 * But it makes the opposite case impossible, and that case is real. When the
 * engine grows a seam this mod needs, the change lands in the game's repository
 * and reaches npm at the next release - so until then there is no way to run
 * this mod against it, and no way to find out that the seam does not actually
 * work until after it has shipped. `NEO_ANGBAND_REPO` already points at a
 * sibling checkout for the content pack (content.ts) and for the plugin builder
 * (tools/build.mjs); the ENGINE was the one thing it did not reach.
 *
 *   NEO_ANGBAND_LOCAL_CORE=1 npm test
 *
 * A SECOND VARIABLE, not just the presence of the checkout. Most developers here
 * have the sibling checkout - the content pack needs it - so keying off that
 * would silently swap the engine under everyone and quietly turn the default
 * into "whatever is on my disk". The opt-in has to be a thing you typed.
 *
 * It resolves to core's BUILT output, because that is what the package's own
 * exports point at and therefore what a consumer gets. An unbuilt checkout is a
 * loud failure below rather than a fallback to node_modules: silently testing
 * the published engine after you asked for the local one is the exact confusion
 * this is meant to end.

   * the sibling engine and the run passed, reporting a version from a checkout
